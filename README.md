Implementing the following on events page of https://www.codingninjas.com/ <br>
<ul>
<li>Pagination with multiple options<br></li>
<li>Persisting tags using localstorage <br></li>
<li><b>Optimized code for fewer of server calls. <br></b></li>
(Specifically the currently the site requests <b>pages</b> from the server but I am fetching all the events of a particular category, sub-category and tags and then based on the page number, showing the users those particular events.)
